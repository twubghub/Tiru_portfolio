[PROJECT ONE: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND HYPOTESIS TESTING OF SURVEY DATA](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/project_2_Notebook.ipynb)

- Apply EDA for 2019 NHIS data; displaying, cleaning and visualising the data.
- Implement hypotesis testing such as, T-test, Z-test, Chi-Square, Anova and so on to test the relationship of different variables and their significant impact into one   another.
- The outcomes and conclusions on different groups based on these various satastical tests.

[PROJECT 2: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH TWO DATASETS](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/Project%202_%20EDA_hypotesis_twodataset.ipynb)


 The project is a group project which focused on hypothesis analysis, the relationship between variables, and identified if a specific outcome significantly differs from group to group.


* Analysis of dataset

* Visualization

* Hypothesis/assumptions for specific questions related to both datasets

* Test the hypothesis and give a conclusion

[PROJECT 3: COMPUTER VISION PROJECT](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/Project%203_Computer_Vision.ipynb)
 This project is a group project manily focused on classification of 10 animal images using convolutional neaural network on spark enviroment and hadoop distribution file system (HDFS) used 
 for storage purpose.
 * Prepared the data and stored it to local HDFS
 *  Accesed the data on spark programing and rearrange the data to fit into the model
 *  Trained many convolutional neaural network (CNN) models by changing their parameters to get better performance accuracy.
 *  Visualized and concluded the results that have gotten from different models.
