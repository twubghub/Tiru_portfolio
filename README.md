[PROJECT 1: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND HYPOTESIS TESTING OF SURVEY DATA](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/project_2_Notebook.ipynb)

- Apply EDA for 2019 NHIS data; displaying, cleaning and visualising the data.
- Implement hypotesis testing such as, T-test, Z-test, Chi-Square, Anova and so on to test the relationship of different variables and their significant impact into one   another.
- The outcomes and conclusions on different groups based on these various satastical tests.

[PROJECT 2: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH TWO DATASETS](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/Project%202_%20EDA_hypotesis_twodataset.ipynb)


 The project is a group project which focused on hypothesis analysis, the relationship between variables, and identified if a specific outcome significantly differs from group to group.


* Analysis of dataset

* Visualization

* Hypothesis/assumptions for specific questions related to both datasets

* Test the hypothesis and give a conclusion

This project is a group project manily focused on big data analysis to classify 10 classes of animal images using convolutional neaural network on spark enviroment and hadoop distribution file system (HDFS) used for storage purpose.
 * Downloaded the data from kaggle and Prepared it to store it to local HDFS.
 *  Analyzed the data using spark programing and rearrange the data to fit it into the models.
 *  Trained many convolutional neaural network (CNN) models by changing their parameters to get a better performance accuracy.
 *  Visualized and concluded the results that have gotten from different models.

[PROJECT 4: CLASSIFICATION PROJECT](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/Project4_DryBeanData.ipynb)
This project is about classification that provides a method to obtain uniform dry beans seed varieties by using machine learning algorithms to classify them with better accuracy than the existing one which was 93.3%.

* Implemented EDA such as dsplaying the data, cleaning the data by removing the duplicated data, avoiding outliers using interquartile method then Balancing classes using SMOTE method.
* Prepared the data and fitted models. we trained many models and apply various techniques to get a better accuracy perforamnce.
* Among the models we used Bagging, SVM nonlinear kernel and keras TensorFlow models provided the highest accuracy more than 95%. 
* Keras provided the highest accuracy for unseen(test) data with 95%.
