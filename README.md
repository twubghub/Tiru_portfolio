[PROJECT 1: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND HYPOTESIS TESTING OF SURVEY DATA](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/project_1_Notebook.ipynb)

* Applied EDA for 2019 NHIS data; displaying, cleaning and visualising the data.
* Implemented hypotesis testing such as, T-test, Z-test, Chi-Square, Anova and so on to test the relationship of different variables and their significant impact into one   another.
* Concluded the outcomes on different groups based on those various satastical tests.

[PROJECT 2: Computer Vision for Object Detection](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/Deep_Learning_project_final.ipynb)


 The project is a group project which focused on building models to detect objects on roads for self driving cars. There are about 11 classes such as cars, truck, signals, pedstrians and others in this project then constructed object detection models to classify, locate and label those classes. 


* Analyzed the dataset

* Visualized the data

* Built models

* Test and Evaluated models

* Used NMS to avoide overlapped bounding boxes

This project is a group project manily focused on big data analysis to classify 10 classes of animal images using convolutional neaural network on spark enviroment and hadoop distribution file system (HDFS) used for storage purpose.
 * Downloaded the data from kaggle and Prepared it to store it to local HDFS.
 *  Analyzed the data using spark programing and rearrange the data to fit it into the models.
 *  Trained many convolutional neaural network (CNN) models by changing their parameters to get a better performance accuracy.
 *  Visualized and concluded the results that have gotten from different models.

[PROJECT 4: CLASSIFICATION PROJECT](https://github.com/twubghub/All_projects/blob/main/Project4_DryBeanData.ipynb)
This project is about classification that provides a method to obtain uniform dry beans seed varieties by using machine learning algorithms to classify them with better accuracy than the existing one which was 93.3%.

![](https://github.com/twubghub/Tiru_portfolio/blob/main/images/DryBeans_image.png)
* Implemented EDA such as dsplaying the data, cleaning the data by removing the duplicated data, avoiding outliers using interquartile range method then Balancing classes using SMOTE method.
* Prepared the data and fitted models. we trained many models and applied various techniques to get a better accuracy perforamnce.
* Evaluated  models, so among the models we used Bagging, SVM nonlinear kernel and keras TensorFlow models provided the highest accuracy more than 95%. 
* Concluded the result. Keras provided the highest accuracy for unseen(test) data with 95%.
